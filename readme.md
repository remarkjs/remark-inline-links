[**remark**][remark] plugin to transform references and definitions into normal
links and images.

## Note!

This plugin is ready for the new parser in remark
([`remarkjs/remark#536`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/pull/536)).
The current and previous versions of the plugin work with the current and
previous versions of remark.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-inline-links
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.md`:

```markdown
[foo], [foo][], [bar][foo].

![foo], ![foo][], ![bar][foo].

[foo]: http://example.com "Example Domain"
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
var fs = require('fs')
var remark = require('remark')
var links = require('remark-inline-links')

remark()
  .use(links)
  .process(fs.readFileSync('example.md'), function(err, file) {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```markdown
[foo](http://example.com "Example Domain"), [foo](http://example.com "Example Domain"), [bar](http://example.com "Example Domain").

![foo](http://example.com "Example Domain"), ![foo](http://example.com "Example Domain"), ![bar](http://example.com "Example Domain").
```
